# Cipher-me

Inspired by "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu in Udemy. I found the Caesar Cipher project in the course is a bit too simple. So I modify it and add features like input text file instead input strings from user directly. And rather than using direct number as shift value in caesar cipher, I'm using strings.
